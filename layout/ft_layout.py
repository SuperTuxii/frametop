"""ft-layout: the Frametop screens' sizes and where they float around you.

Two desktop backends (BACKEND in ~/.config/frametop.conf):
  screens    (default) ft-screens, our own compositor (screens): each screen
             is its own SteamVR panel with its own resolution and size in metres. ft-layout
             places them directly through ft-screens' control socket (@ft_screens).
  gamescope  the old path: every screen one size (at most 1920x1080 worth of pixels),
             panels owned by the SteamVR dashboard, so ft-layout floats each one with
             `vrcmd --dock-overlay` and the pointer helper carries it into place.

The layout is relative to your head when it's applied: its position and the direction
you face (yaw only), like a recenter. It lives in ~/.config/frametop-layout.json:
  {"auto": true,                      arrange when the desktop starts
   "mode": "preset" | "custom",
   "preset": {"kind": "arc" | "flat", "rows": 1, "distance": 2.0, "gap": 0.05, "height": 0},
   "primary": 2,                      the screen with the taskbar (1-based; default: the biggest)
   "layouts": {"Work": [{"pos": ..., "face": ..., "roll": ..., "metres": ..., "curve": ...,
                         "pin": ...}, ...]},   named layouts: each screen's place (SPATIAL)
   "active": "Work",                  the named layout the custom arrangement came from
   "profiles": {"Work": {"hidden": [3], "windows": [...]}},   what a named layout opens too
                                      (docs/profiles.md): screens hidden on their own, and the
                                      apps' windows (ft-floatd's "windows")
   "default_profile": "Work",         the profile the desktop starts with (FT_PROFILE overrides)
   "visibility": {"mode": "always",   ft-screens: always | dashboard (only with the SteamVR
                  "wrist_angle": 60,    dashboard open) | gesture (while you look at a controller)
                  "gesture_hand": "left", "gesture_angle": 20},   | toggle (hidden until shown);
                                      wrist_angle: a pinned screen shows while you see its front
                                      within this many degrees
   "screens": [{"size": [w, h], "metres": 3.6,        ft-screens: pixels, and width in VR
                "curve": 0,                           ft-screens: cylinder radius in metres, 0 = flat
                "pin": {"hand": "left", "rel": [12]},  ft-screens: riding on that controller
                                                      (left | right), or on the headset (head)
                "scale": 1.0,                         KWin output scale (1.0 = 100%)
                "hidden": true,                       ft-screens: hidden on its own, whatever the
                                                      visibility mode (ft-layout hide N)
                "pos": [x, y, z], "face": [yaw, pitch], "roll": 0,   custom layout
                "rotation": "normal" | "left" | "right"}, ...],      gamescope only
   "panel_size": [w, h]}              gamescope: last measured panel size
Custom positions: x right, y up, -z forward from the head, in metres; face = the
direction you look to see the screen's front straight on, in degrees, relative to your
heading; roll = the panel turned about its front, counterclockwise as you see it.
Presets: "arc" hinges the screens edge to edge around you, each turned to face you
(like monitors on a desk); "flat" puts them on one flat wall facing forward. Screen 1
is top left, then left to right.

Usage (on the Frame host; Frametop Display Settings calls it too):
  ft-layout apply [--wait SECONDS]   arrange every screen; --wait is for desktop start:
                                     wait for the screens, skip if "auto" is off
  ft-layout capture                  save the current arrangement as the custom layout
  ft-layout save NAME                save it as a named layout too, and use that; with the
                                     desktop's apps and hidden screens, as a profile
  ft-layout use NAME                 switch to a named layout, arrange the screens in it, and
                                     open its apps (moving open windows, nothing closed)
  ft-layout start [--wait SECONDS]   desktop start: the profile in FT_PROFILE or default_profile,
                                     or else as apply --wait
  ft-layout open NAME                a profile's launcher entry: use it, or start the desktop in it
  ft-layout default NAME|none        the profile the desktop starts with
  ft-layout layouts                  list the named layouts (* = the one in use)
  ft-layout rename OLD NEW | delete NAME
  ft-layout launchers                write each profile's launcher entry again (and drop stale ones)
  ft-layout plan                     print the arrangement as JSON (no VR needed)
  ft-layout scale                    per-screen scale, positions (as the screens are around
                                     you), and primary to KWin
  ft-layout screen-args              ft-screens' --screen arguments for the session script
  ft-layout remote-view              the primary screen's place in the workspace, for the VNC bridge
  ft-layout toggle                   hide or show all screens (ft-screens)
  ft-layout hide N|all               hide a screen on its own (it stays hidden whatever the
  ft-layout show N|all               visibility mode or the hotkey say), or show it again
  ft-layout hidden                   the screens hidden on their own
  ft-layout pin all|N left|right|head  pin screens to a wrist or your head as they are;
                                     unpin all|N
